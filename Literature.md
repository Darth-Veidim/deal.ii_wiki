# Some books on the finite element method

## Literature on learning finite elements

### English

 - <b>Dietrich Braess</b>: Finite Elements : Theory, Fast Solvers, and Applications in Solid Mechanics, Cambridge
   - Exposition of the method and theoretical results with some not so standard applications

 - <b>Susanne C. Brenner, L. Ridgway Scott</b>: The Mathematical Theory of Finite Element Methods, Springer, 2002
   - Excellent introduction into the theory of finite elements, including multigrid and Schwarz solvers. Recommended for mathematicians.

 - <b>Philippe G. Ciarlet</b>: The Finite Element Method for Elliptic Problems, SIAM Classics in Applied Mathematics
    - Very abstract, but still the bible.


### German

 - <b>Christian Großmann, Hans-Görg Roos</b>: Numerik partieller Differentialgleichungen, Teubner
   - Probably the best exposition for students and researchers available.
 
 - <b>Hans Rudolf Schwarz</b>: Methode der finiten Elemente, Teubner
   - Although some of the coding considerations are hopelessly outdated, the book is a good introduction to finite elements from a practical point of view.
