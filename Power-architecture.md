Installing deal.II on Power architecture is pretty straightforward if you are using `gcc`. The only difficulty comes from `TBB` which is an Intel library. Therefore, the bundled version of `TBB` won't compile. Instead, you will need to download the patched version of `TBB` from [here](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/W51a7ffcf4dfd_4b40_9d82_446ebc23c550/page/IBM%20Advance%20Toolchain%20for%20PowerLinux%20Documentation?section=distros). You can download the code associated to any distribution since you are only interested in the source code. The easiest way to install `TBB` is to replace the `include` and `src` directories of the bundled `TBB` with the patched ones. Don't forget to replace the `Makefile` in `src` from the patched `TBB` with the `CMakeLists.txt` in `src` from the bundled `TBB`. Now, deal.II will install the patched `TBB` for you.
