Installing deal.II on Power architecture is pretty straightforward if you are using `gcc`. The only difficulty comes from `TBB` which is an Intel library. Therefore, the bundled version of `TBB` won't compile. Instead, you will need to download the patched version of `TBB` from [here](https://developer.ibm.com/linuxonpower/advance-toolchain/). You can download the code associated to any distribution since you are only interested in the source code. The easiest way to install `TBB` is to replace the `include` and `src` directories of the bundled `TBB` with the patched ones. Don't forget to replace the `Makefile` in `src` from the patched `TBB` with the `CMakeLists.txt` in `src` from the bundled `TBB`. Now, deal.II will install the patched `TBB` for you.
